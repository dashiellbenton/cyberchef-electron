# CyberChef-Electron

Local CyberChef html file, but it's for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Updating

Download the local HTML file from https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ (top left, `Download CyberChef`)

Unzip the file and copy the HTML into this repo. Rename it to "CyberChef.html" and it'll be done!
